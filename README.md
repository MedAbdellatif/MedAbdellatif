# Power BI Sales Dashboard 
                                                
I have used Power BI to create a Sales Dashobrad that could be used by the management team to:
 - Track KPIs (Revenue, Sales,Profits ..)
 - Regional Performance
 - Analyse product Level Trends
 - Identify High-value customers
